However, some concern persists around workload balance and recognition. Feedback like "deadlines are always tight" suggests a need for better pacing or clearer prioritization.

Risk Type: Burnout & Manager Disconnect
Severity: High
Key Indicators:
- Engagement dropped 28% in the last 30 days

- Manager feedback scores down 31%

Primary causes appear to be increased workload following the recent product launch and perceived lack of leadership support. Three team members specifically mentioned feeling "disconnected from leadership decisions."
